# 🎓 WBSU AI Lab Assistant

**Turn your College Code Repository into an Intelligent Study Companion.**

This project uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Google's Gemini AI to transform a static folder of C/Python lab programs into an active teaching assistant.

## 🚀 Features

1.  **Chat with your Labs (RAG):** Ask questions like "How did I implement the matrix multiplication logic?" and get answers based on *your* specific code.
2.  **Viva Voce Simulator:** The AI acts as an External Examiner, scanning your code and generating strictly graded viva questions to prepare you for exams.
3.  **Auto-Report Generator:** Instantly synthesizes formal "Aim," "Algorithm," and "Conclusion" text for your physical lab notebook.
4.  **License Awareness:** Built-in awareness of the ESAL-1.0 license to prevent academic dishonesty.

## 🛠️ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/WBSU-AI-Lab-Assistant.git](https://github.com/your-username/WBSU-AI-Lab-Assistant.git)
    cd WBSU-AI-Lab-Assistant
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run wbsu_lab_assistant.py
    ```
