# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability or a way to bypass the academic integrity guardrails (e.g., jailbreaking the prompt to make it write your entire exam), please report it to the maintainers immediately.

**Do not create a public GitHub issue for vulnerabilities.**

Please email the project maintainer directly. We will address the issue as soon as possible.
